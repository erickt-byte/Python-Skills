# Python-Skills
Data analysis of US insurance data. This analysis was made without uses of python libraries 
The analysis was made to investigate anomalies in the insurances cost based on gender and region. The project was made on Jupiter Notbook, so each step of the analysis has a very clear description
I avoided using python libraries as Pandas, Numpy or Scipy to showcase skills that are solely relative to Python
